## ✨ Overview

**Jarvis** is a fully local 🖥️ Windows desktop assistant built in 🐍 **Python** with 🎨 **PySide6**.  
It combines a sleek futuristic interface with a practical local AI core that can:

- 🧠 understand flexible natural language  
- 📁 create files and folders  
- 🌐 open apps and websites  
- 🎤 handle microphone input and 🔊 text-to-speech  
- 🖱️ control parts of the desktop safely  
- 🧰 route requests through an extensible tool system  
- 🛡️ apply confirmations and guardrails for sensitive actions  

This project is focused on **legitimate personal desktop automation only**.

## 🚀 Why This Project Is Cool

Jarvis is not just a static command launcher.

It has been upgraded into a more modern 🤖 **agent-style assistant** with:

- 🧠 intent recognition  
- 🔍 entity extraction  
- 🪄 action planning  
- 🧰 tool selection  
- 🧾 lightweight memory and context
